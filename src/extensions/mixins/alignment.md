# Alignment Extensions

There are only few extensions available for the Alignment Mixin and they are the only one which we will need in any widget. Thats why we are not having any configuration option in `tailwind.config.json` file.

| Extension     | Description                    |
| ------------- | ------------------------------ |
| .topCenter    | Align widget to `topCenter`    |
| .topLeft      | Align widget to `topLeft`      |
| .topRight     | Align widget to `topRight`     |
| .center       | Align widget to `center`       |
| .centerLeft   | Align widget to `centerLeft`   |
| .centerRight  | Align widget to `centerRight`  |
| .bottomCenter | Align widget to `bottomCenter` |
| .bottomLeft   | Align widget to `bottomLeft`   |
| .bottomRight  | Align widget to `bottomRight`  |
